# hello-world
My first repository.

Hi, I'm Jason Fisher. After many years of wanting to learn to code but instead pursuing other career paths, such as finance and nursing, I am finally getting started. I've dabbled, but now I'm dedicated. This is my second career change, which is admittedly a bit more daunting than when I was younger. However, I am excited, having fun so far, and really looking forward to seeing what I can create. Outside of working and coding, I love hiking, biking, and kayaking in the outdoors as well as tacos.
